TODO
jsunit
selenium
take tests from our repo
<!-- code example platforms : silex & symfony & js & selenium & js unit-->


beginner level
first boring stuff
discussion would be more beneficial
shoot questions
talk about exp. idea

methods:
	the boxes wont be used much in practice
	visual : clear, easy to repeat
	Static&dynamic : compiled&not compiled
	The focus : automated


Static Testing
		codereview : f4h
		inspection : sf2
		walkthrough :
	useful as much as automated

noteworthy
	smoke : crucial & prevent further tests
			db acces & read - write
			app server 
			static files
			3rd party

Facts:
	assertions : http://www.phpunit.de/manual/3.4/en/appendixes.assertions.html
	&code coverage 
		show code
		see dead lines

I am an idiot : 
	explain first
	straight forward, readable

Famous duo:
	unit test : let us refactor

Test doubles:
	mock : used in unit & behavior verification
	stub :
	Significant difference BV & SV

Integration Tests:
	Fixture os tool

jsunit : library aside from html
		 tools, phantom etc, load on same page
		 phantomjs zombiejs qunit

selenium : expensive (hard to setup,)

ci : after every commit
		 regularly



	WISH LIST 

-> mocking test data in general	
testing commands		
what is unit testing		
border between unit and integration testing		
what to test in a unit test		
how to test requests		
frontend tests (frameworks)		
code coverage		
zombie, phantom etc.		
Travis and other ci tools
