symfony 
jsunit
selenium

<!-- code example platforms : silex & symfony & js & selenium & js unit-->

group session therapy
first boring stuff
discussion would be more beneficial
shoot questions

methods:
	the boxes wont be used much in practice

Static Testing
		codereview : f4h
		inspection : sf2
		walkthrough : youtube api videos /geoff stearns 


jsunit : library asid from html
		 tools, phantom etc, load on same page
selenium : expensive (hard to setup,)




Fancy words list

	smoke : origin from electrical engineering, is smoke coming from cpu?
			smoke test fails are critical, easy to fix
			if smoke test fails no need to test further

	code coverage : gmob experience with removing

	ci : after every commit
		 regularly


	show code examples for each of them

Even more

	fixture : the data necessary to run the test

	show code examples for each of them
