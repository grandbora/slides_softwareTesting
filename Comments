TODO
jsunit
selenium
take tests from our repo
<!-- code example platforms : silex & symfony & js & selenium & js unit-->




first boring stuff
discussion would be more beneficial
shoot questions
talk about exp. idea

methods:
	the boxes wont be used much in practice
	Static&dynamic : focus automated dynamic&visual


Static Testing
		codereview : f4h
		inspection : sf2
		walkthrough :
	useful as much as automated

noteworthy
	smoke : crucial & prevent further tests

Facts:
	assertion &code coverage show code

I am an idiot : 
	explain first

Famous duo:
	unit test : let us refactor

Test doubles:
	mock : used in unit & behavior verification
	stub :
	Significant difference BV & SV

Integration Tests:
	Fixture os tool




jsunit : library asid from html
		 tools, phantom etc, load on same page
selenium : expensive (hard to setup,)




Fancy words list

	smoke : origin from electrical engineering, is smoke coming from cpu?
			smoke test fails are critical, easy to fix
			if smoke test fails no need to test further

	code coverage : gmob experience with removing

	ci : after every commit
		 regularly


	show code examples for each of them

Even more

	fixture : the data necessary to run the test

	show code examples for each of them

	


	WISH LIST
